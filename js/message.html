<p>Dear Sir/Madam,<br> 
    A very good morning to you.<br> 
    It is a matter of immense pleasure informing you that, we are organizing a Two Week Workshop and Summer School on “<a href="https://cvbl.iiita.ac.in/adasiva2018/">Advances in Deep Architectures for Signal, Image &amp; Vision Applications</a>” during
July 14, 2018, to July 28, 2018. <br>
The objectives of the workshop are highlighted as follows - 
<ol>
    <li>Building awareness towards deep learning architectures.</li>
    <li>Building communities of research students, educator, R&amp;D, and Industry persons in this emerging area of research and development.</li>
    <li>Providing hands-on tutorial sessions, where the participants can experiment with concepts and methods.</li>
    <li>Building the technical capacity in the area of Signal, Image, and Vision Processing via deep architectures.</li>
    <li>Providing a platform to showcase the research work through the Technical paper and poster presentation.</li>
</ol>
All of us are aware of the fact that the Deep Learning domain is quite thrilling now a days and many researchers (students/faculty members/industries)
started doing research in this important domain, but very little expertise is available in India. In ADASIVA-2018, 17 prominent speakers have confirmed their participation uptil now. The details of the summer school can be found at https://cvbl.iiita.ac.in/adasiva2018/. <br><br>
<strong style="font-weight: 400; font-style:italic ;font-size: 18px; color: red;">You are also requested to kindly circulate the same among the peer group interested in the same domain.</strong>
<br><br><br><br>Sincerely,
<br>
